# thermal_website
This repo contains the files for the Thermal Imaging Attacks website requested by Mo. I used Local to create the website locally, it also offers integrations for a couple of hosting solutions too so it's quite useful.

The file conatined is a zip of all relevant files for the WordPress site, to add this to Local, download it, then drag it to the Local window, this will let you import it, no need to extract or anything.
